      <h1><a id="Frequently-asked-questions" href="#Frequently-asked-questions" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<p>There are a couple of questions we have been asked over and over again&#x2026;</p>
<h2><a id="ally-not-a11y" href="#ally-not-a11y" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>&quot;ally&quot; not &quot;a11y&quot;?</h2>
<p>When the project started in October 2014, it was called &quot;a11y.js&quot;. We didn&apos;t register any domains or grabbed the npm package name - which turned out to be a problem a couple of weeks later. We&apos;re not sad this happened.</p>
<p>&quot;ally&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">phonetic</a> <code>&#xE6;laj</code>) is easier to pronounce than &quot;a11y&quot; (phonetic <code>&#x259; &#x259;l&#x25B;v&#x259;n waj</code>). &quot;a11y&quot; is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym">numeronym</a> and expands to &quot;accessibility&quot;. &quot;ally&quot; has a number of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ally">definitions</a> ranging from &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;cooperating&quot;, which has a much nicer tone to it.</p>
<h2><a id="Why-was-this-created" href="#Why-was-this-created" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Why was this created?</h2>
<p>While trying to learn accessibility in general and keyboard navigation in particular, it became obvious that the web was not making things very easy. Tutorials were missing important pieces - coherence and a focus on the developer usually wasn&apos;t a thing. Examples looked like their JavaScript was written in the 90s, or depended on jQuery, or simply skipped the meaty parts.</p>
<p>We weren&apos;t able to use any of the existing solutions. We also weren&apos;t going to just copy paste other people&apos;s code into our applications and let the cycle repeat. We wanted to create the basis for accessibility experts and web developers to <em>collaborate</em> in a way that might help everyone.</p>
<h2><a id="Ultimate-goal" href="#Ultimate-goal" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Ultimate goal?</h2>
<p>In theory the ultimate goal for ally.js is to make itself obsolete because web standards and browser implementations have caught up. This isn&apos;t very likely to happen any time soon, if at all. In the meanwhile the goal is to provide all the low-level utilities required for other libraries and websites and applications to make accessible experiences an easier target. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/medialize/ally.js/tree/master/GOALS.md">GOALS.md</a> to find out what we&apos;re planning.</p>
<h2><a id="Where-was-this-created" href="#Where-was-this-created" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Where was this created?</h2>
<p>Initial efforts were spurred by the <a href="https://www.qivicon.com/en/">Smart Home platform</a> of Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom is not an official sponsor of this project. However, they have let me work on this project as part of my job at the office.</p>
<h2><a id="Corporate-backing" href="#Corporate-backing" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Corporate backing?</h2>
<p>As of today ally.js does not receive official funding or guidance from anyone. We&apos;d be happy to hand over stewardship to a web-standards-involved organization that understands OSS and the community.</p>
<h2><a id="Multiple-personality-disorder" href="#Multiple-personality-disorder" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Multiple personality disorder?</h2>
<p>Most of the documentation was written from a group perspective (&quot;we have done&#x2026;&quot;), but some statements are personal (&quot;I have done&quot;). I have gone with the group voice, because I hope it won&apos;t take long for others to join the project. That said, while I have <em>created</em> most of the resources so far, many people have been involved in figuring out how to do things.</p>
